## Where am I??

What you're on right now is a digital garden !

It's my little corner of the internet (see [The importance of digital gardens in metric-driven social media](https://notes.johnmavrick.com/the-importance-of-digital-gardens-in-metric-driven-social-media/)) where I publicly share my notes related to what I'm doing, what content I'm consuming, etc.

### How do I navigate this vault?

Digital gardens are websites organized by bi-directional links instead of by time or alphabetical order.

This means that rigid structures are not the main form of organization - you explore notes by hopping between links, Maps of Content (MOCs), and a limited folder system using your curiosity as your north star.

### How do I make my own?

I edit this using Obsidian, a note-taking software that I use for my Second Brain. 

To host my notes, I use the [Obsidian Digital Garden Plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) .

I would use Obsidian Publish, but the problem with it is some plugins that I use a lot like Dataview don't work properly (which is an integral part of my note organization).

### I'm interested in your notes and what you're doing, but I don't want to have to manually revisit you...

If only I had a wordpress where I could force feed you the cooler resources I consumed, notes I took, and things I did throughout the week...

If you do want to stalk me though, hopefully the below can help make it easier ^^
